special action team captain:How long before we get to the manor? Miss Sotherby, we've been driving for more than 40 minutes. 

Sotheby:Soon around the corner ahead and we’re out,then.. Huh?!What's that shadow? It's moving! And there's water on it! 

Apple:Waffle, that's the Manus Vindictae's believer! Get around now, don't let them see us.
special action team captain:No, we can't turn around now. 

Sotheby:No! They've found us! 

Sonetto:Let's fight. Put an end to all that's happening in this ridiculous forest.
Sonetto:We must not let the Manus know where we are going. 

special action team captain:Copy. Let's make it fast.

Sonetto:There should be no other enemies. Are you alright? Is anybody hurt? 
Sonetto:Are you okay, Mr. Apple? 

Apple:I got accidentally splashed by they slime. It must contain a high concentration of toxins…*cough*

Sotheby:Whoa, you are going mouldy. 
Sotheby:You need the antidote made from leeches, glass lizard blood, black fern root and at least two phoenix heart nerves. 
Sotheby:They are very hard to find, but fortunately I have them all.

Apple:Thank you. But this apple might need a little bit of... Mancozeb.

Sotheby:‘’Mango cub’’? What's that? 
Sotheby:Huh!Mr. Apple passed out.
Sotheby:Don't worry, don't worry. I've got all kinds of potion materials at my house. I'll get them when we're back.

[after the 'auto Island' passing through 10 different Gardens,they finally get to the gate of the manor]
Sotheby:Finally got home. That's weird. Where is everybody? Anyone there? Someone needs an antidote! 
Sonetto:Is that... A unicorn on the wall? It turned around.I thought it was a statue, but it is still alive? 

Sotheby:It's not a statue. It is the quiet Ravenheart.

Marian:The sorcerer and heretic? Oh God, forgive me sweet Mary, mother of Jesus. 
Marian:What has flown over? God bless us! 

Sotheby:IOh, don't be afraid. HAHAHA…That's my dearest Sasana.You are here to welcome me. 

Sonetto:Susana? Well, this is the first time I've seen so many arcane creatures and plants for real. 

Sotheby:IIt's a mini Schnellgeister.My father found it near the Blue Ridge Mountains in Braddock Heights. Don't worry, it no longer sucks human blood. It's my good friend now and will welcome you home every time.
Sotheby:ISpeaking of which... It's so weird. Why are all the servants at the door today? Mr. Carson would never allow this. 
Sotheby:IMr. Carson! Sotheby is back! Mr. Carson? 

Sonetto:It seems there's no one else but us here.

Sotheby:IWell, it's really weird. Forget it. Leave Mr. Carson alone.I have to find the ‘mango carro’t quickly. I will be back soon. Hold on in there, Mr. Apple.

special action team captain:What Mr. Apple just mentioned... Is it really ‘mango carrot’?

Sonetto:I'm so sorry. I did not hear it clearly either. I made a small cut of his leaf to release venom.
Hopefully the toxin will take effect slower.

Marian:Um... I think what he said was... ‘Mangozeb’. An organometallic fungicide humans apply on plants.

Sotheby:Ma... Me... Mon. Not in the index starting with ‘M’.So... . Co... Co... Cost... 
Sotheby:Nothing. How could it be possible? We should have all the potion materials in our warehouse.Is that... In Latin? What can I do? I promised to cure Mr. Apple! 

[clang]

Sotheby:hmm!? Did I hear something? 

[clang clang]

Sotheby:Someone is here! What happened? This floor is a private storage area. Servants are strictly forbidden. And I never met any servant along the way.
Sotheby:Phew! Around This corner... im Just gonna sneak a peek, making no sound. 
Sotheby:Mr. Carson! 

Mr. Carson:Miss Sotheby, you're back! 

Sotheby:You... Why are you standing in front of our number 18 vault?
